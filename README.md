# crime_map
A 3D viewer for crime stats.

Information gathered from couple sites:

- Crime stats: [FBI CRIME IN US](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s). The stats I used are from 2013 to 2018, because 2019's stats is just too incomplete and I'm too lazy to clean data beyond 2013.
- County population: [From United Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html).
- Map: [Wiki](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Usa_counties_large.svg).

Needless to say, all of the data, including map needs to be cleaned. You can find all the information used for this project in this repo.
